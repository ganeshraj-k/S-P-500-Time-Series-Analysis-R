# S&P 500 Financial Index Analysis and Prediction

## 🎯 Goal
The primary goal of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of the global factors influencing the S&P 500 Financial Index and how these factors will impact the stocks of companies moving forward. We aim to conduct an in-depth analysis of how this index functions and comprehend the various components that drive the market.

## 📚 Dataset
We utilize a dataset from Kaggle, a Data Science repository, containing attributes like Date, Open, High, Close, and Volume. The focus is on recent data post-2019, as significant events during this period have stirred concerns among financial experts.

## 📈 Methodology
Our analysis begins by plotting S&P 500 trends. While helpful, these trends alone don't fully represent stock behavior. Candlestick charts, representing High, Low, Open, and Close values, provide better insight. Sector-wise analysis offers deeper understanding, including line graphs, box plots, and bar plots. These depict trends and disparities among sectors. 

We forecast using an ARIMA model. Stationarity tests and auto ARIMA help determine the best model. Forecasting Pfizer's data shows its future trend. However, the model's accuracy is tested using the Ljung-Box test.

## 📝 Conclusion
Our analysis of the S&P 500 Index highlights the mutual influence of world events and companies. In-depth sector-wise analysis reveals varying impacts of events on different sectors. Pfizer's future trend is forecasted using ARIMA. This project successfully conducts a Time Series Analysis and Prediction of the S&P 500 Financial Index for 2019-2022.
